DO NOT ORDFER V1.0 REMOTE BCD DECODER BOARD

The Remote BCD Band Decoder board V1.0 from 20 January 2025 has an error in the schematic
and the PCB resulting in the 3 Demux chip input lines being shorted together.  The traces are generally easy
to access and cut except for RN1 which must be removed first. 6 wire jumpers are put in place to correct.  
See the Wiki Pages for how and where to do this.

V1.1 schematic and PCB files have replaced this V1.0 board.  The USB Decoder board is unaffected.

31 Jan 2025 - CN1 changed from 1K to 220ohm for a stronger pullup.  1K was marginal.

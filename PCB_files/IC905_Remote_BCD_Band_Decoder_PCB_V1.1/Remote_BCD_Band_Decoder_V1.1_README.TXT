Remote_BCD_Band_Decoder_V1.1_README.TXT - 31-Jan-2025

V1.1 fixes an error on the V1.0 board from 20-Jan 2025.  On the original board the 3 BCD input lines between U4, U5 U1 and RN1 were shorted on the schematic and during layout resulted in all connection shorted with a single trace.  Also added silkscreen labels for connector and pin headers.

Correcting a V1.0 board requires cutting some traces and soldering in jumper wires.  The traces are easy to access.  Details are in the Wiki Pages.

V1.0 is obsolete and should not be ordered.  Use this V1.1 or newer revisions instead.  V1.0 is retained on this repository as a reference for the up to 20 existing boards someone may try to build.
